 You are to create a single class.  Within that class you are to
 write the main method.
 The main method will call all other methods, unless a
 method is called by another method.

 Page	 Problem
 238	 6.18
 239	 6.21
 240	 6.27
 240	 6.29

 You will include a design tool representing each
 of the problems above.  It can be one big thing
 or individual tools for each problem.
 Remember only a single main method…calling
 all other method….
 Each member of the team will submit the exact
 same thing to BB.

**6.18 (Check password) Some websites impose certain rules for passwords. Write a method that checks whether a string is a valid password.
Suppose the password rules are as follows:

■ A password must have at least eight characters.
■ A password consists of only letters and digits.
■ A password must contain at least two digits.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password and displays Valid Password if the rules are followed or Invalid Password otherwise.

6.21 (Phone keypads) The international standard letter/number mapping for telephones is shown in Programming Exercise 4.15.
Write a method that returns a number, given an uppercase letter, as follows:
int getNumber(char uppercaseLetter)

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter a phone number as a string. The input number may contain letters.
The program translates a letter (uppercase or lowercase) to a digit and leaves all other characters intact.


Here is a sample run of the program:

￼￼￼￼Enter a string: 1-800-Flowers

1-800-3569377

￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Enter a string: 1800flowers

18003569377

6.27 (Emirp) An emirp (prime spelled backward) is a nonpalindromic prime number whose reversal is also a prime.
For example, 17 is a prime and 71 is a prime, so 17 and 71 are emirps. Write a program that displays the first 100 emirps.

Display 10 numbers per line, separated by exactly one space, as follows:
         13 17 31 37 71 73 79 97 107 113
         149 157 167 179 199 311 337 347 359 389
         ...

6.29 (Twin primes) Twin primes are a pair of prime numbers that differ by 2.
For exam- ple, 3 and 5 are twin primes, 5 and 7 are twin primes, and 11 and 13 are twin primes.
Write a program to find all twin primes less than 1,000. Display the output as follows:

         (3, 5)

         (5, 7)

         ...
